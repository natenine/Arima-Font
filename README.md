**ARIMA TAMIL + MALAYALAM + TAMIL**

<i> First Release </i>

A display font with soft edges and calligraphic feel would be the mains inspiration for the Tamil font design. It would have low contrast to allow good rendering on screen. Legibility will be always a concern but we will give it a lot of personality to be recognizable as a display font to be used in headlines, for brand names or similar uses on the web.
Our primary goal is to create a popular design that creates engagement first and foremost with lay people but never lowering the quality of the design. 
The weights will be tested on the low resolution phones to get the best possible result.
We will use ttfautohint to hint the fonts. Starting from the first round of design testing, we will check its rendering on Windows, and comment on problems with the hinting in the project thread.
